## What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools.
Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.
